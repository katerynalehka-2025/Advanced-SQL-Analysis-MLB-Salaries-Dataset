# Advanced-SQL-Analysis-MLB-Salaries-Dataset
Final SQL project analyzing MLB player careers, schools, teams, and salaries using advanced SQL techniques including window functions, CTEs, ranking, time-based analysis, and cumulative metrics.
Project overview

This project is a final advanced SQL case study completed using an MLB-related dataset, including player information, schools, teams, and salary history. The project focuses on answering complex analytical questions related to player careers, team spending, education pipelines, and long-term trends in professional baseball.
All queries were written independently by interpreting task requirements and expected outcomes, with a strong emphasis on analytical reasoning and clean SQL design.

Business & analytical questions addressed

The project answers a wide range of real-world analytical questions, including:

Education & player pipelines
How many schools produced MLB players in each decade?
Which schools produced the most players overall?
What were the top 3 player-producing schools per decade?
Team spending & financial trends
Which teams fall into the top 20% by average annual spending?
How has cumulative team spending evolved over time?
In which year did each team surpass $1 billion in total salary spending?
Player career analysis
Player age at debut and final game
Career length, ranked from longest to shortest
Starting and ending teams for each player
Players who started and ended on the same team and played over a decade
Players sharing the same birthday
Roster composition & demographics
Batting-hand distribution by team (right, left, both)
Percentage breakdown of batting styles per team
Physical trends over time
Changes in average player height and weight at debut
Decade-over-decade differences using window functions

SQL techniques & concepts used
